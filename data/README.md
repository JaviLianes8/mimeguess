# Source snapshots

This folder holds upstream data that is not committed. `MANIFEST.json` pins each file
(URL, revision, size, SHA-256, licence) and `python scripts/fetch_upstream.py` downloads
the files here, checking every hash; git ignores everything but this README and the
manifest. Without the files the package still works and its tests pass: the generator
check and the tests that read them skip.

## mime-db-1.54.0.json

- What: `db.json` from jshttp mime-db 1.54.0 (published 2025-03-18). It merges
  the IANA Media Types registry, Apache httpd `mime.types` and nginx
  `mime.types`, recording for each type which of them it came from.
- License: MIT. The notice is in `LICENSES/mime-db.txt` and ships in the wheel,
  because `src/mimeguess/_data.json.gz` is derived from this file.
- Used by: `scripts/generate_table.py`, which builds `src/mimeguess/_data.json.gz`
  and `src/mimeguess/_meta.py` from it.

## apache-httpd-mime.types-r1930012

- What: `docs/conf/mime.types` from Apache httpd trunk, SVN revision 1930012.
- License: the file header places it in the public domain.
- Used by: `tests/test_crosscheck.py` only, as an independent check. It is not
  part of the generated table or the wheel.

## Updating

1. Change the URL, revision, size and SHA-256 in `MANIFEST.json` and run
   `python scripts/fetch_upstream.py`.
2. Update the paths and constants at the top of `scripts/generate_table.py`.
3. Run `python scripts/generate_table.py`, then the test suite. Review the diff
   of `tests/golden/` and the pinned counts in the tests; regenerate the golden
   conflict file from the matching mime-types release as described in
   `tests/golden/PROVENANCE.txt`.
